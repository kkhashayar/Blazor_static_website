            I am a self-taught Python programmer interested in web stacks, socket programming, SQL databases, game development and GUI programming.
            I have 10+ years of experience as a desktop support and IT consultant, mostly I have worked in hardware assembly, upgrade, troubleshooting lines and so on.
            I speak English, Italian, and Norwegian at the intermediate level (improvement is ongoing) and Persian is my mother tongue.
